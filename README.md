# Customer-Churn-Prediction
# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on various behavioral and transactional features collected from an e-commerce platform.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is **E Commerce Dataset.xlsx** containing details such as:
- Customer activity (logins, sessions)
- Purchase frequency
- Spending patterns
- Complaint history
- Membership duration

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Normalized numerical features
- Feature engineering for improving model performance

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized churn vs non-churn distribution
- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature impact plots (e.g., spending vs churn)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

Trained and evaluated:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix
